# Affiliate Disclosure

At **BrainBoost Hub**, we believe in honesty and transparency with our readers. Our website contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you click on a link and make a purchase—at no additional cost to you.

## What Are Affiliate Links?

Affiliate links are special tracking links. If you purchase a product or service after clicking one of these links, we may receive a small commission or other compensation from the company. This helps support the site and allows us to keep providing high-quality content, guides, and reviews for free.

## Our Promise to You

- **Honest Reviews:** Our editorial content, reviews, and recommendations are always based on our honest opinions, research, and experiences. We only promote products and services that we genuinely believe in and that we think will benefit our readers.
- **No Extra Cost:** Using our affiliate links will never increase the price you pay for any product or service.
- **Transparency:** We will always disclose when a link is an affiliate link or when content is sponsored or in partnership with a brand.

## Why Do We Use Affiliate Links?

Affiliate commissions help cover the costs of running BrainBoost Hub, including hosting, tools, and the time spent researching and creating valuable content. They allow us to keep the site independent and free for everyone.
